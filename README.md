Coffeepot that sends out tweets when ready

Place 2 wires (pin7 and GND) into the water reservoir.
When the water is gone, the coffee is done, and the arduino sends out a tweet.

Don't forget to set your own fixed IP adress (I found that using DHCP does not work :-/), 
and that you replace <OAUTH KEY HERE> with your own key you obtained at https://arduino-tweet.appspot.com/
